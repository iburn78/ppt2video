To update a package on **PyPI** (Python Package Index), the process is somewhat similar to updating a version in **Git**, but there are a few specific steps you need to follow. When you update a package on PyPI, you need to:

1. **Update the version** of your package.
2. **Build new distribution files** (wheel and source distributions).
3. **Upload the new version** to PyPI.

Here’s a detailed guide:

### Steps to Update Your Package on PyPI:

#### 1. **Update the Version in Your `setup.py`**
- PyPI requires that you increment the version number whenever you upload a new release. For example, if your current version is `0.1.0`, you might update it to `0.2.0` or `1.0.0` based on your changes.
  
In your `setup.py`, update the `version` field:
  
```python
setup(
    name="ppt2video",
    version="0.2.0",  # Increment the version number
    ...
)
```

#### 2. **Build the Distribution Files**
- After updating the version, you need to rebuild the distribution files (`.tar.gz` and `.whl`), which will be uploaded to PyPI.

In your project directory (where `setup.py` is located), run:
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This will create a `dist/` folder containing the distribution files (e.g., `ppt2video-0.2.0.tar.gz` and `ppt2video-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`).

#### 3. **Upload the New Version with `twine`**
- After building the new distribution files, you can upload them to PyPI using **Twine**.

If you haven’t already installed `twine`, do so with:
```bash
pip install twine
```

Then, upload the distribution files from the `dist/` folder to PyPI:
```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

- You will be prompted for your **PyPI credentials** (or your API token if you set it up).

#### 4. **Verify the Upload**
- Once the upload is successful, you can verify that the new version is available on your PyPI package page (e.g., `https://pypi.org/project/ppt2video/`).
  
- You should see the new version listed on the page.

#### 5. **Testing the New Version**
- To make sure the new version is uploaded correctly, you can install it via `pip`:
  
  ```bash
  pip install ppt2video --upgrade
  ```

This will install the latest version of your package.

### Key Considerations:
- **Versioning**: PyPI enforces strict versioning. You cannot upload a new version with the same version number. Always increment the version (e.g., `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`).
  
- **Changelog**: It’s a good practice to maintain a **CHANGELOG** for your package, so users know what has changed between versions.

- **Automated Releases**: If you regularly update your package, consider using **GitHub Actions** or another CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and releasing your package.

### Example Workflow Summary:

1. **Update version** in `setup.py`.
2. **Build distributions**: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`.
3. **Upload to PyPI**: `twine upload dist/*`.
4. **Verify the upload** on the PyPI website.
